# Front Technical Test / LaBanqui.se

Here is the technical test you have waited for. <br>
**Wait a minute ? All is in english ???**<br>
Yes, we also test that you can understand technical english. But, hey, relax and all will be fine.
There is no time limit for this test, you have access to all the ressources you want : website, google, udemy, stackoverflow. This is excluding people : don't ask your older sister to code for you 😉.
So, now, my last advice : follow the instructions 🥧
